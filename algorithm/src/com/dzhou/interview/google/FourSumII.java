 * 454. 4Sum II
 * 
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * 
 * Given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many tuples (i, j,
 * k, l) there are such that A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] is zero.
 * 
 * To make problem a bit easier, all A, B, C, D have same length of N where 0 ≤
 * N ≤ 500. All integers are in the range of -228 to 228 - 1 and the result is
 * guaranteed to be at most 231 - 1.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: <br>
 * A = [ 1, 2] <br>
 * B = [-2,-1] <br>
 * C = [-1, 2] <br>
 * D = [ 0, 2] <br>
 * 
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * Explanation: <br>
 * The two tuples are: <br>
 * 1. (0, 0, 0, 1) -> A[0] + B[0] + C[0] + D[1] = 1 + (-2) + (-1) + 2 = 0 <br>
 * 2. (1, 1, 0, 0) -> A[1] + B[1] + C[0] + D[0] = 2 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 = 0 <br>
